# Keep Typing and the Story Continues!

[My Notes](notes.md)

This web application is an adaptation of the popular elementary game of "Once upon a time..." but with the implementation of a 6-player game room. The application uses a timer to make the game competitive, and the last one standing is the victor.

## 🚀 Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [X] Proper use of Markdown
- [X] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [ ] Description of key features
- [ ] Description of how you will use each technology
- [ ] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Have you ever wondered who the most quick-witted person is in your friend group? Maybe you've tested that out in the playground, where each person continues the story you've started out with until it went from Antarctica to Narnia? This Keep Typing and the Story Continues! application lets you join a 6-player game where all players, in turn, attempt to continue the story while a timer ticks down. Once the timer reaches zero? Boom! You're out of the game. Channel your inner James Bond, and become the 007 of the writing world (at least, in your friend group!)
